Make sure you install FFMpeg to here or else the program **WILL NOT WORK**!
Ensure you also set the folder to just copy over instead of not do anything.
Drag and drop the "bin" folder from an FFMpeg install into this folder such that the directory here should be `<working_dir>/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe`
I recommend you get all of them (ffmpeg, ffplay, and ffprobe) just in case. However, they should not be needed.
